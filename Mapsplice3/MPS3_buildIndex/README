The index consists of two part:
1). whole genome index 
2). local index

buildWholeGenomeIndex_final.cpp is used to build the 1st part of index and buildAll2ndLevelIndex.cpp is used to build the 2nd part.

Phase 1 only need the 1st part of index.(i.e, if you run phase 1 only, no need to run buildAll2ndLevelIndex.cpp ) 

And Phase 2 only need the 2nd part of index and the chromsome sequence files.
